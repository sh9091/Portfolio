  <h2 class = "headers" id = "history" >History</h2>

<p class = "design">Pizza originated in Naples, Italy as a quick and easy meal for working-class citizens to eat on the go. Pizza started to gain popularity in North America in the 1940s when Italians started to immigrate and reside there. It is now a trendy dish around the world as it allows for the customization of toppings. Pizza is known for being a popular party dish due to most people enjoying it. </p>

<p class = "design"> For cheap and easy pizza that still tastes good I would recommend Pizza Alps. My family and I like this place as the pizza is good and the prices are reasonable. I usually order Special#2 when with my family which has a price of $40.98. Here is a link to the specials: <a href = "https://www.pizzaalps.ca/en/order-online">Pizza Alps </a> </p>
